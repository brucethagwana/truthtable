# Truth Table

A 'truth table' is a mathematical formal table that is used in logic, i.e., in Boolean algebra and propositional calculus, to determine the functional values of logical expressions on each functional argument of theirs, i.e., on each pair of values taken by their logical variables.

To create a 'truth table', I have to know:

1. The logical expression or statement you wish to study. This will involve variables (like P, Q, R) and the logical connectives (like AND, OR, NOT, IF... THEN, IF AND ONLY IF).

For example, do you want a 'truth table' for:

> P AND Q
> P OR NOT Q
> (P IF THEN Q) IF AND ONLY IF (NOT P OR Q)

Once you provide the expression, I can construct the 'truth table' showing all possible truth values (TRUE|T or FALSE|F) for the variables and the truth value of the entire expression, which is obtained.

## App Development & Refinement Status

This section provides an overview of our progress in the development and refinement phase. We aim for transparency and regular updates here.

### Current Tech Stack

This application is being developed using the following core technologies:

- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **Primary Language:** Python Programing Language
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, pgvector
- **Frontend Templating:** Django Templates
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS EC2-

### Testing Stack

Our testing strategy employs a multi-layered approach to ensure the robustness, reliability, and user-friendliness of the 'truth table' App project. We utilize a combination of unit, integration, API, and end-to-end tests, leveraging specific tools for each level.

- **Unit & Integration Testing (Backend - Pytest-Django):**
  - Goal: To verify individual components (units) of the Django backend work as expected in isolation, and that integrated modules function correctly together.
  * Tool: pytest with pytest-django
- **API Testing (Postman):**
  - Goal: To ensure that the backend API endpoints function correctly, return expected data formats, handle various HTTP methods, and enforce security policies. This bridges the gap between backend logic and frontend consumption.
  * Tool: Postman
- **End-to-End Testing (Frontend & User Flows - Cypress):**-
  - Goal: To simulate real user interactions and verify that the entire application, from frontend UI to backend logic and database, functions correctly as a cohesive system. This ensures critical user journeys are unbroken.
  * Tool: Cypress

- **June 13, 2025:** Addressed critical login bug affecting certain user account.
- **June 9, 2025:** Began work on real-time core business logic functionality.

### Legend

- **Completed:** This task/milestone has been successfully finished.
- **In Progress:** Work is actively being done on this task.
- **Not Started / Planned:** This task is planned for future development.
- **Blocked:** This task cannot proceed due to an external dependency or issue.

### Looking Ahead
